The AI engineer's work trajectory chronicles the development of a comprehensive time tracking application for LDA Group. Initially, the AI engineer struggled to recover previous context, leading to a decision to rebuild the application from scratch based on a high-level summary provided by the user. This involved implementing a FastAPI backend for core business logic (time tracking, materials, jobs, reporting) and a React frontend for user interaction (worker/admin dashboards).

Subsequent iterations focused on addressing missing critical features and implementing numerous enhancements. Key challenges included backend API development, frontend component creation, data serialization issues (MongoDB ObjectId), and detailed UI/UX refinements like branding, dynamic filtering, and complex reporting. The engineer systematically tackled requests, first updating backend models/endpoints, then frontend components, often restarting services, and performing comprehensive testing after each major phase. The trajectory highlights a cycle of user feedback, problem identification, implementation (backend then frontend), and testing, showing the evolution of the application from a basic template to a feature-rich solution with robust admin controls.

<product_requirements>
The user aims to build a comprehensive time tracking application for LDA Group.
Initial requirements included:
1.  **Core Time Tracking**: Workers can clock in/out with GPS location stamps.
2.  **Materials Management**: Track materials purchased for jobs with cost calculations.
3.  **Admin Dashboard**: Complete reporting system with filtering and analytics.
4.  **Branding**: LDA Group name, specific red color (#D11F2F), and GBP currency (£).
5.  **Backend APIs**: Endpoints for workers, jobs, time entries, materials, and reporting.

After the initial build, crucial missing features were identified:
1.  **Secure Admin Authentication**: A dedicated admin login with password.
2.  **User/Worker Management**: Ability for admins to add, edit, delete, and archive workers, including setting their hourly rates.
3.  **Job Management**: Ability for admins to add, edit, delete, and archive jobs, along with unarchiving.
4.  **Detailed Job Reports**: Individual job reports gathering all time spent and material costs.
5.  **Enhanced Exports**: CSV export for job-specific reports, including clock-in/out GPS locations and addresses.
6.  **UI/UX Refinements**: Hiding default credentials, fixing UI layouts (Jobs page actions), changing button styles, displaying company values and logo, alphabetical sorting for worker lists, job filtering by client and status.
7.  **Time Entry Editing**: Admin ability to edit existing time entries or manually clock workers in/out.
8.  **Attendance Alerts**: Dashboard log for late logins/early logouts, excluding admins.
9.  **Data Consistency**: Archived jobs should not show in active lists; proper authorization for job edits.
</product_requirements>

<key_technical_concepts>

-   **Styling**: Tailwind CSS for responsive and customizable UI.
-   **Environment Variables**: Strict adherence to  for  and .
-   **Service Management**: Supervisor for running frontend/backend, Kubernetes Ingress for routing with  prefix.
-   **GPS Integration**: Storing and retrieving latitude/longitude coordinates and addresses for time entries.
-   **Data Serialization**: Handling complex data types like dates, UUIDs, and ensuring proper JSON serialization for API responses.

Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was addressing a new set of 12 issues and enhancements requested by the user. These included:
1.  **Archived Job Visibility**: Ensuring archived jobs are hidden from active lists.
2.  **Job Editing Authorization**: Fixing not authorized error when editing jobs.
3.  **New Admin User Login**: Resolving Invalid admin credentials for newly added admins.
4.  **Hide Default Admin Credentials**: Removing hardcoded credentials from the login page.
5.  **Jobs Page UI Fixes**: Correcting hidden actions and column changes when including archived jobs.
6.  **Jobs Page Actions**: Hiding the export function and styling actions as red background, white text buttons.
7.  **Time Entry Editing**: Adding admin capability to edit time entries on the reports page.
8.  **Attendance Dashboard Log**: Displaying late login/early logout alerts on the dashboard (excluding admins).
9.  **Exclude Admins from Worker Dropdown**: Removing admin users from worker selection lists.
10. **Alphabetical Worker Sorting**: Organizing the worker dropdown list alphabetically.
11. **Job Unarchiving**: Adding a feature to unarchive jobs.
12. **Job Filtering & Export**: Implementing client/status filtering and CSV export on the Job Management page.

The AI engineer has implemented these changes by modifying backend endpoints (for archived jobs, job editing auth, new admin auth, unarchiving jobs, attendance alerts) and extensively updating frontend components (Login, AdminDashboard, JobEditModal, and introducing a new EditTimeEntryModal). The most recent action was to initiate a comprehensive test of all these newly implemented features.
